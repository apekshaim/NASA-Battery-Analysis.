# NASA-Battery-Analysis.
This project analyzes the aging of Li-ion batteries by visualizing changes in electrolyte resistance (Re) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) across charge/discharge cycles. The analysis uses the NASA Battery Dataset to track how these parameters evolve over time, providing insights into battery performance and aging.
